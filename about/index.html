  <p>Hi there, I'm an aspiring data scientist/machine learning engineer who enjoys thinking about and working on data problems. 
    I am currently studying a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence degree and am having a great time learning every day.
    I also have a keen interest in VR/AR projects and the sustainability industry. 
    In my free time, I like to work on amateur creative projects such as artistic 3D modelling using softwares such as Blender, learn game development using Unity/Unreal Engine and write science fiction stories.</p>
    In future, I hope to be able to marry AI technology and creative ventures with a focus on sustainability.
